title: About
---

Adelbert is a software engineer in the Bay Area. His day job tends to involve working on tooling
and infrastructure. In his free time he enjoys writing, teaching, and learning about functional
programming.

This blog serves primarily as a journal for me. I expect many posts to be about the new things I learn.
Writing about these will help solidify my understanding and hopefully help those learning as well.

I also blog Scala things over on the [Typelevel blog](http://typelevel.org/blog/).

My handle on Twitter is my first and last name stuck together.
